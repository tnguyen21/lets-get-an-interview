              I honestly believe there are only 3 things you need to keep in
              mind to have a higher sucecss rate with sending in resumes. Make
              it really easy to skim, remember that it's your highlight reel and
              you only need to show the best work you've ever done, and that it
              should be targeted to the job description your applying for.
              Competitive jobs will have so many applications that they will
              have the luxury to pick someone with pre-existing competencies.
              Make it clear you're one of those people -- even if you don't feel
              like you are. You can and will become someone who does that job
              well, but only if you can get an interview and get the offer in
              the first place.

            <h3>The Job Search 🔭</h3>
            <aside class="notes">
              I'm a strong believer in keeping things simple and automated. The
              same goes for trying to keep an eye out on work that you think
              would be interesting to do, and would pay you well. I highly,
              highly recommend finding newsletters related to your career
              interests and subscribing to them. Even if you never read them
              regularly, it's nice to passively curate them. This way, when the
              time comes and you are looking for a job, you'll already have a
              stockpile of resources to reference for your search.
